- For more than 10 years, big tech companies, such as OpenAI, Meta, Google, have been sparing no expense for developing Large Language Models as one of the generative AI models.
- And now, it has undoubtedly become one of the most powerful technologies, changing the greater part of interfaces in most industries.
- Following the trend, from December 2021, Korean Navy has started to construct the Naval Regulation Chatbot system, in which users input what they wanna ask and Large Language Model response to it.
- As a matter of fact, the current naval regulation search system only depends on keyword-based search algorithm which can find proper regulations only if words in user's query exactly match with words in regulations.
- Therefore, to increase accessibility to regulations and their ease of use, our project aims to make the Naval Regulation Chatbot which can analyze user's query semantically and answer the query in a dialog form.
- This system can contribute to heightening the efficiency of office work and providing useful guidelines for junior officers.
